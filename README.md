# Machine Learning Internship Projects at Cantilever

This repository contains the projects completed during my one-month Machine Learning Internship at Cantilever (Octoberâ€“November 2025).  
The internship provided hands-on exposure to real-world machine learning workflows and practical problem-solving in a professional environment.

## Project 1: Sentiment Analysis System

This project implements a complete workflow for sentiment classification using Natural Language Processing techniques. The goal is to train a machine learning model that predicts whether a given text review is positive or negative.

### Technologies Used

| Category | Tools |
|----------|-------|
| Programming Language | Python |
| Machine Learning | Scikit-learn |
| NLP Toolkit | NLTK |
| Data Processing | Pandas, NumPy |
| Development Environment | JupyterLab |

### Process Overview

**1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Used the NLTK Movie Reviews dataset containing 2000 labeled reviews  
- Performed tokenization, stopword removal and lemmatization  

**2. Feature Extraction**  
- Converted text into TF-IDF numerical vectors  

**3. Model Training**  
- Trained a LinearSVC (Support Vector Machine) model on 80% of the dataset  

**4. Evaluation**  
- Achieved an accuracy of **87.50%** on the remaining 20% test data
